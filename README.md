# leetcode in C
This repo stores solutions(using C language) of Leetcode's interesting questions I have solved.
(My current progress is 400/885)
I solve all this on my own, and therefore the solutions is neither the most concise nor the most efficient.
(I am not a good programmer!)


The only purpose of this repo is to help myself better preparing the code interview.
But I would be more than happy, if this can do some help in your leetcode journey.
In the future, I will add some notes for these solutions, if I have time!
