# leetcode
This repo stores solutions of interesting questions I have solved (my current progress is 112/856). 
I solved all this on my own, and therefore the solutions is not the most concise nor the most efficient.
(I am not a good programmer!)
The only purpose of this repo is to help myself better preparing code interview.
But I would be more than happy, if this can do some help in your leetcode journey.

In the future, I will add some note for this solutions, if I have time!
